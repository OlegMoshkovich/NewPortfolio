What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
The most fascinating thing that I learned is the fact that the elements of AI is all around us.
I heard about it before - however I did not fully realized the extend of the AI presence
I started machine learning course with Andrew NG and learned about
linearregresion algorithms
and logistic regression
and the basic mathematics behind neural networks
</div>

<div id="Quesion2">
WHat do you want to be doing in 2 years
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
in two years I would like to be proficient with machine learning methodologies and data science
I would like to be able to apply this methodologies to generate products thata are meant to
help people in one or another
provide more insights in to the practice of design - green architecture and construction

</div>

<div id="Quesion3">
Why do you want to attend the Recurse Center?
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
I would like to attent the Recurse Center to focus on developing programing craft.
The 6 weeks of focus on programming exclusively and a great desire and rediness to learn the craft
will provided me with the opportunity to obtain knowledge I desire, and hone on the skillset
that is very important.
</div>


<div id="Quesion4">
What would you like to work on at the Recurse Center?
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
While in ther center I would like to work on general understanding of functional programming and datascience.
I want to complete a machine learning project end to end in different languages  - python and javascript, and make an
application that would accept a dataset in the form of json upload the data to the cloud database
and vizualize that data - suggest the anomolies and help the user to do all of the operations necessary to prepare the
dataset for the machine learning algorithm
</div>


<div id="Quesion5">
Describe your programming background in a few sentences.
</div>

<div id="Answer1">
  I started experimenting with programing during my time at the grad school about 10 years ago.
  Back then the maini forcus of programing task was aroung processing - and automation of geometry analysis using c++.
  About 4 year ago I decided to learn web develoment and attended 10 weeks corse to learn ruby on rails, I made
  2 web apps that help illustrate how certain processed could be better improved using a webapp for the
  data colleciton
  I noticed that node offers greater flexibility, learned fundumnetals of express and made several apps in Node,
  javascript is what I have been learning + practicing and still practicing. I tried a bit of react, and d3 vizualization

</div>

<div id="Quesion6">
Have you worked professionally as a programmer?
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
never professionally but I did use programming to prototype ideas at work - and to demonstrate the potential
</div>

<div id="Quesion7">
Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
do not have a degree - and not seeking it at this point
</div>

<div id="Quesion7">
  How did you hear about RC?
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
I heard about RC about 4 years ago at the time of ruby class - however did not feel I was ready for the self directed
studies. now I am
