<div id="Quesion1">
What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
The most fascinating thing that I learned is the fact that the elements of AI is all around us.
I heard about it before - however I did not fully realized the extend of the AI presence
I started Ð° machine learning course with Andrew NG and learned about
linearregresion algorithms
and logistic regression
and the basic mathematics behind neural networks. That sparked my interest in Algortithm and Data science.
I started listening to the expalination of the divide and conquer algortihms, and currently learning about merge sort.
At the moment I am reading the first book in the foundation series, and that is quite fascinating.
</div>

<div id="Quesion2">
WHat do you want to be doing in 2 years
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
in two years I would like to be proficient with machine learning methodologies and do work realted to datascience and AI.
I would like to be able to apply this methodologies to generate products thata are meant to
help people in one or another
provide more insights in to the practice of design of sustainable architecture and construction.
I would like to be a part of a team of excellent and aligned individuals and do work that is directly related to solving
problems related to Global warming.

<div id="Quesion3">
Why do you want to attend the Recurse Center?
</div>
<div id="Answer1">
I would like to attent the Recurse Center to focus on developing programing craft, and to be surrounded by
inspiring and interesting people.
I have been working on developing ability to program by myself for a long time, it has always been in parallel.
I feel ready to focus exclusively on programming and would like to be in the atmosphere where I am surrounded by
people who are focued and driven.

<div id="Quesion4">
What would you like to work on at the Recurse Center?
</div>
<br>
<div id="Answer1">
While in ther center I would like to focus my work on machine learning and datascience.
I want to complete a machine learning project end to end. I would like to work with data, organize and visualize
data, regularize data and apply apply machine learning tequnies to analyze dataset and make predictions based on the
insights contained in the data.

<div id="Quesion5">
Describe your programming background in a few sentences.
</div>
<br>
<div id="Answer1">
  I started experimenting with programing during my time at the grad school about 10 years ago.
  Back then the main forcus of programing task was aroung physical computing and data visualization
  using processsing.
  Also I learned automation of geometrical analysis using c++.
  About 4 year ago I decided to learn web develoment and attended 10 weeks course to learn ruby on rails.
  At that time I worked for MTA on Grand Central Mega Project. It was apparent that the data collections methods
  used for managing the project required a serious upgrade, I used my web development skills to prototype the solutions
  and to illustrate available improvements.
  After working with Rail for a shortwhile I was attracted to Node, so I learned express and expremented with developing
  in javascript. d3 is fascinating labrary, I am practicing it at the moment.
</div>
<br>
<div id="Quesion6">
Have you worked professionally as a programmer?
</div>
<br>
<div id="Answer1">
never professionally but I did use programming to prototype ideas at work, and illustrate potenatial of smarter solutions.
</div>
<br>
<div id="Quesion7">
Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?
</div>
<br>
<div id="Answer1">
do not have a degree - and not seeking it at this point
</div>
<br>
<div id="Quesion7">
  How did you hear about RC?
</div>
<br>
<div id="Answer1">
I heard about RC about 4 years ago at the time of ruby class - however did not feel I was ready for the self directed
studies. I feel right now is the perfect time for me.
