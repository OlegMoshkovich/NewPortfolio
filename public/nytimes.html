            I am looking for the team where I can do intellectually and creatively challenging work, surrounded by brilliant colleagues who believe in the cause and are inspired by our work and the outcome. After learning about the special digital projects group, I cannot think of any other place in New York that fascinated me more.
            In this role I hope to be able to work with the colleagues to discover and prototype useful and delightful solutions for the readers and journalists, I also hope to contribute my skills towards production level software.
            I am interested in the team because of the team members, <a href="https://open.nytimes.com/develop-your-culture-like-software-a1a3c1acfd6e">culture</a> and the current <a href="https://stackshare.io/posts/evolution-of-new-york-times-tech-stack">technologies</a> used by the organization.
            On the global value level, I deeply respect New York Times for staying relevant and true to the values, as well as for the use of technology to re-invent storytelling and news.
